# Petals and Passion ðŸ’®
This was an Off Platform Project via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path). I created a made-up flower companies homepage using the flex property.

### What programming languages did I use?
I used HTML and CSS to create my project.

### What makes your webpage stand out?
I made sure to include a flowery background to attract users, flower images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) as well a pink-coloured aesthetic with green coloured fonts to symbolise a colour of a flower.

Here is an image of my project so far:

The background is not displayed with the picture, come and see what it looks like [here](https://shan-establishments.github.io/Petals-and-Passion/).
